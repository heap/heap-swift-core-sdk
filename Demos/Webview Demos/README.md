# HeapSwiftCore Webview Demos

> This project is not intended to show normal or expected use of HeapSwiftCore.
> It exists to demonstrate specific behaviors of the SDK and aid in development.

This app demonstrates behaviors of our `WKWebView` integration. It was added to support development
of webview session deduplication but will also aid in development of `HeapBridgeSupport` and
`@heap/heap-javascript-bridge-support` autocapture extensions.
